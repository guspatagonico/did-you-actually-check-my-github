# Did You Actually Check My GitHub?

If you actually bothered to read this, you just have to say that the codeword is "Huenei Ruca" and I'll be so impressed that I'll consider you more than a contact, a strategic tech, a possible business partner and maybe even a great friend. I am being entirely serious. No one has ever actually done any diligence before hiring me. Please, for the love of God, actually vet me.
